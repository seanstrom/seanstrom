# Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sean

### I'm a creative engineer who designs and programs software.

* Iâ€™ve been working professionally as an app developer on the web for over nine years. Along the way, Iâ€™ve been a part of building and shipping mobile and desktop apps, as well as server infrastructure and devops.

* Recently, I graduated from Goldsmiths University of London as a masterâ€™s student in Virtual Reality. In my studies, I was expanding my skill-set into the 3D world of modeling, animation, and game engines.

* Currently, Iâ€™m building tools for thought at [Nette](https://nette.io) <br/>and exploring new mediums for research, digital gardening, and exploratory AI.

* Moving forward, Iâ€™ll be pursuing my passion for understanding <br/>and documenting the creative and technical process of making wonderful things.

* In general, Iâ€™m always seeking opportunities to contribute to <br/>fascinating ideas and collaborate with delightful people.
