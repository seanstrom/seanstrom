# Hey 👋, I'm Sean

### I'm a creative engineer who designs and programs software.

* I’m a software engineer focused on crafting interactive systems where design, information, and performance intertwine.
* My work has led me to explore spatial interfaces and editor-like workflows, built upon enriched data models and expressive interactions.
* I’m particularly interested in tools and systems that help people navigate information, reason about ideas, and work creatively.
* I enjoy collaborating with people who care deeply about craft, taste, and thoughtful problem-solving.
