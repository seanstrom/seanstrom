# Hey 👋, I'm Sean

### I design and build interactive software systems.
* I’m a software engineer focused on frontend and application architecture, where interaction design, structured data, and performance align.
*	Much of my work explores spatial interfaces and editor-like workflows built on deterministic layout systems and expressive UI primitives.
*	I’m interested in tools that help people navigate complexity, reason clearly, and build thoughtfully.
*	I value collaboration with people who care about craft, clarity, and long-term system quality.
