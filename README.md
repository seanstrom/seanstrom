# Hey 👋, I'm Sean

### I design and build interactive software systems.
* I’m a software engineer focused on frontend and application architecture, aligning interaction design, structured data, and performance.
*	Much of my work explores spatial interfaces and editor-like workflows grounded in deterministic layout systems and expressive UI primitives.
*	I’m drawn to tools that help people navigate complexity, reason clearly, and build thoughtfully.
*	I value collaboration with teams that prioritize craft, clarity, and long-term system quality.
