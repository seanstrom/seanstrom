# Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sean
### I'm a creative programmer who designs and programs software.

* Iâ€™ve been working professionally as an app developer on the web for over eight years. Along the way Iâ€™ve been a part of building and shipping mobile and desktop apps, as well as server infrastructure and devops.

* Recently, I graduated from Goldsmiths University of London as a masters student in Virtual Reality.
In my studies, I was expanding my skill-set into the 3D world of modeling, animation, and game engines.

* Currently, I'm building tools for thought at [Nette](https://nette.io) and exploring new mediums for digital toys and games.
