# Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sean
### I'm a creative technologist who designs and programs software.

* Iâ€™ve been working professionally as an app developer on the web for over eight years. Along the way Iâ€™ve been a part of building and shipping mobile and desktop apps, as well as server infrastructure and devops.

* Currently Iâ€™m graduating from Goldsmiths University of London as a masters student in Virtual Reality. In my studies Iâ€™ve been expanding my skill-set into the 3D world of modeling, animation, and game engines.
